For a reference of the translation file format, see:
https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html

Before you can work in the project, you have to prepare the project build,
a procedure similar to what's explained in the README.md file:

	autoreconf -i && ./configure

This needs to be done only once. If this gives no errors, you're good to go.


Translations can be found in the po/ directory, named after the ISO 639 code
name of the language (e.g. po/pt_BR.po for Brazilian Portuguese).

If you want to add a new language, you need to start by generating a template
file, e.g. for Romanian (code: ro):

	(cd po && msginit -l ro)

This will generate a template po/ro.po file you can edit.

If you're adding a new language, you need to add it's code to the LINGUAS
file in order to include it in the build.

After updating a .po file, you can build it with:

	make update-po

In order to submit updates or new translations, ideally use Git and make a
pull request or submit a patch by email.

In order to distinguish these changes, please prefix the commit messages with
"po: ".
