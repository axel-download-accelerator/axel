      as GCC hardening sent by Debian.
* gui/: removed. The binary axel-kapt depended on kaptain that is no longer
        available for QT5 (dead upstream development). For details, see
        https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=789819
* http.c: fix a possible buffer overflow.

  GNU/Hurd. This change was provided by Barry deFreese <bdefreese@debian.org>,
  as a patch to Debian project, on 11 Jun 2009. For details, see
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=532793

  [ Mark Smith ] 2010-07-03

  [ unknown person ] 2011-04-12

*  Fixed an issue that produces a Bad HTTP Request when 302 redirected link is
   longer than 255 chars (like youtube). For details, see
   https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=313080&group_id=100070&atid=413085

  [ Osamu Aoki ] 2012-03-10

  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=663286 and
  https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=313565&group_id=100070&atid=413085
* Changed the configure file to honor the noopt when building. So, was removed

- Fixed configure for OpenBSD.
- Fixed configuration bug: s/alternate_interface/alternate_output/ in
  axelrc.example, thanks to CLOTILDE Guy Daniel for the bug report!
- Fixed weird behaviour when downloading from an unsupported server.
- Fixed buffer overflow in conn.c. (CAN-2005-0390)

Finished Apr 06 2005


Version 1.0a:
- gstrip on Solaris/SPARC breaks the binary, so stripping is made optional
  (but enabled by default!) and /usr/ccs/bin/strip is used instead of
  gstrip.
- Fixed a small (not harmful) errorcode interpretation bug in the ftp_size
  code.
- Downloading from unsupported sites works better now.
- Added support for downloading using more than one local network interface.
- Fixed a potential SIGSEGV bug. Would only happen with about more than 64
  connections usually. Still strange things can happen with too many
  connections when using Linux..
- Hopefully fixed the problem with downloading from forwarding URL's.
- HTTP %-escapes are handled now.
- Alternate progress indicator with estimation of remaining download time
- Changed the return-code a bit, see man-page for details.

Finished Feb 19 2002

- Fixed a reconnect problem: Check for stalled connections was skipped by
  previous versions if there is no active connection.
- Solaris does not have www in /etc/services which confused Axel. Fixed.
- Created a new build system.
- install utility not used anymore: Solaris' install does weird things.
- Added support for Cygwin and Solaris.
- Corrected a little problem in de.po.
- Thrown out the packaging stuff.

Finished Dec 6 2001


Version 0.99b brings you:
- Debian package bugfix.
- Restored i18n support.

Finished Nov 16 2001


Version 0.99a brings you:
- Small bugfix for dumb HTTP bug.

Finished Nov 10 2001


Version 0.99 brings you:
- Improved speed limiter. (For low speeds a smaller buffer works better,
  so the buffer is resized automatically for low speeds.)
- Some FTP servers don't ask for a password which confused ftp.c. Fixed.
- Some HTTP servers send chunked data when using HTTP/1.1. So I went back
  to HTTP/1.0.. (This also fixes the occasional filesearching.com problem)
- Even more problems with FTP server reply codes, but they must be fixed
  now, Axel's RFC compliant.
- For HTTP downloads a Range: header is not sent when downloading starting
  at byte 0. This is just a work-around for a problem with a weird webserver
  which sends corrupted data when a Range: header is sent. It's just a
  work-around for a rare problem, it does not really fix anything.
- RPM package for axel-kapt added.

Finished Nov 9 2001


Version 0.98 brings you:
- Fixed the weird percentage indicator bug. (Was buggy for large files,
  did not affect the downloaded data.)
- For single connection downloads from Apache: Apache returns a 200 result
  code when the specified file range is the complete file. Axel handles
  this correctly now.
- Roxen FTP servers return the address and port number without brackets
  after a passive command. This is RFC-compliant but quite unique. But now
  handled correctly.
- Fixed some things to make it work on Darwin again.
- 'Upgraded' HTTP requests to HTTP/1.1. Tried this to fix a download
  corruption bug for downloads from archive.progeny.com, but it did not
  work. wget's resume has exactly the same problem. But using HTTP/1.1 is
  more compliant (because in fact HTTP/1.0 does not support Ranges) so I'll
  keep it this way..
- Previous version used to delete the statefile in some cases. Fixed.

Finished Nov 3 2001


Version 0.97 (Bitcrusher) brings you:
- Major redesign: Moved a lot of code from main() to separate functions,
  it should make it easier to create different interfaces for the program.
- All those ifdefs were a mess, they don't exist anymore. Separate threads
  for setting up connections are used by default now. Version 0.96 will not
  disappear, by the way.
- HTTP HEAD request not used anymore: Squid's headers are incorrect when
  using the HEAD request.
- conn_disconnect did not work for FTP connections through HTTP proxies.
- Documentation fix, sort of: The example configuration file still said
  proxies are unsupported. But they are supported for quite some time
  already.
- Wrote a small (Small? Larger than any other doc.. :-) description of the
  Axel API.
- Added finish_time code. (Credits to sjoerd@huiswerkservice.nl)
- Calling conn_setup without calling conn_init first also works when using
  a proxy now.
- A client for filesearching.com. You can use it to search for mirrors and
  download from more than mirror at once.
- Fixed another segfault bug which did not show up on my own system...
  Also fixed by 0.96a.
- Global error string is gone. Unusable in threaded programs.
- The -V switch stopped working some time ago because I forgot to put it
  in the getopt string. Now it's back, alive and kickin'...
- TYPE I should be done quite early. Some servers return weird file sizes
  when still in ASCII mode.
- ftp.c (ftp_wait) sometimes resized conn->message to below MAX_STRING
  which is Not Good(tm).
- I18N support is a bit broken at this time, it'll be fixed later.
- Tidied up the man-page a bit.
- Removed config.h file, -D flags used again.
- Added axel-kapt interface.
- Changed syntax: Local file must be specified using the -o option now.
  This allows the user to specify more than one URL and all of them will
  be used for the download. A local directory can be passed as well, the
  program will append the correct filename.
- Fixed a bug which caused the program not to be able to download files
  for which only one byte has to be downloaded for one of the connections.
- Why bitcrusher? Just because I liked to have a code name for this
  release... Bit crusher is a name of a musical group here in the
  Netherlands, and it's a nice name for a downloader as well, I hope...

Finished Oct 25 2001


Version 0.96 brings you:
- Fixed a terrible bug which caused any FTP download to corrupt. I promise
  I will test the program before any next release. :-(( HTTP did work in
  0.95.

Finished Aug 14 2001 (Why is this fix so late? Because the actual release
of version 0.95 was only last Friday/Saturday...)

And yes, I tested it now. It works now. HTTP and FTP.


Version 0.95 brings you:
- An important bugfix: When bringing up the connection failed, the program
  used to be unable to reconnect. :(
- Small changes to make the program compile on FreeBSD and Darwin.
- Support check for FTP servers is done only once now.
- SIZE command is really used now.
- Fixed a SIGINT-does-not-abort problem. Btw: Ctrl-\ (SIGQUIT) always works!
- Connection status messages are not displayed by default. You can enable
  them with the verbose-option.

Finished Aug 7 2001


Version 0.94 brings you:
- 'make install' uses install instead of mkdir/cp now.
- Added 'make uninstall' option.
- Added more explanations to axelrc.example.
- It uses the HTTP HEAD request now. Didn't know that one before. :)
- Debian packaging stuff and RPM .spec file included by default.
- select() problem now really understood... The real point was, that
  sometimes select() was called with an empty fd set. Now I solved the
  problem in a more 'useful' way.

Finished Jun 26 2001


Version 0.93 brings you:
- A compile-time option to remove all the multi-connection stuff. Program
  works without state files then, and it's a bit smaller, just in case you
  need a very small program and if you don't believe in acceleration. :)
- The SIZE command is now used as long as the URL does not contain wildcards.
  Because FTP servers are just too different. :(
- You can do FTP downloads through HTTP proxies now.
- The weird initial 1-second delay which happened sometimes does not exist
  anymore: It was because of select(), which does not return immediately
  if there's data on a socket before the call starts. My first solution
  is using a lower timeout, I hope there's a better solution available...
- Local file existence check.
- Small bug fixed in conf.c.

Finished May 22 2001


Version 0.92 brings you:
- A credits file!! ;)
- A German translation. Herrman J. Beckers: Thanks a lot!
- ftp.c should understand weird Macintosh FTP servers too, now.
- Connections are initialized in a different thread because then the program
  can go on downloading data from other connections while setting up. Quick
  hack, but it works.
- config.h contains the configuration definitions now.
- A URL - can be specified. The program will read a URL from stdin. Might
  be useful if you don't want other people to see the URL in the 'ps aux'
  output. (Think about passwords in URLs...)

Finished May 11 2001


Version 0.91 brings you:
- A man page.
- A quiet mode.
- A Debian package. (0.9 .deb exists too, but that was after the 'official'
  0.9 release..)
- Made the sizes/times displayed after downloading more human-readable.
- Corrected some stupid things in the nl.po file.
- No bug in ftp_wait anymore, (or at least one bug less ;) the program was a
  bit too late with the realloc() sometimes. I just hate those multi-line
  replies.. :(
- HTTP proxy support. no_proxy configuration flag also in use.
- Support for empty configuration strings.
- URL parser understands wrongly formatted URLs like slashdot.org. (instead
  of the correct http://slashdot.org/)

Finished Apr 30 2001


Version 0.9 brings you:
- See the README for all the old features.
- Internationalization support.
- Clearer error messages.
- Probably some bug fixes too.
- A highly sophisticated Makefile.. ;)

Finished Apr 22 2001
